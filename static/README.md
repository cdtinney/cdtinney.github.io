## Introduction

This website is built with:

* [GatsbyJS](gatsbyjs.org) for static website generation using React
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration (CI)
  and deployment to GitHub pages

## Getting Started

Development is done on the `develop` branch.
  * All commits to `develop` are automatically deployed.
  * Development should be done on branches sourced from `develop`, NOT `master`.

Deployment (i.e. build output) is found on `master`.
  * This is because GitHub Pages User Pages must be deployed on `master`.

### Requirements

* Node.js - Latest LTS release

### Installing

```
$ npm install
```

### Running

```
$ npm run develop
```

### Building

To build the website for production:

```
$ npm run build
```
