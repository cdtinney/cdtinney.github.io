title: "Questions to ask technical interviewers"
---

In 2019, I quit my old job, moved to `$CHEAP_TROPICAL_PLACE` and started interviewing with companies I was interested
in working for (spoiler: I accepted an offer from [Square](https://squareup.com/careers) [p.s. we're hiring!]).

Part of interviewing involves asking potential colleagues and managers probing questions, trying to
figure out if the company/team/manager is a good fit for you. So, I need to come up with some.

I scoured the internet for lists and wrote down a lot. In the end, I kept asking the same questions
-- ones that would help me most with my decision making -- over and over again.

[Here's my list.](https://xkcd.com/927/)

**To engineers:**

Q: Tell me about a project you're particularly proud of.

> Why? Gauge the scope of an individuals contributions, and learn about something they consider a success. Hopefully
it's aligned with your expectations for your responsibilities.

**To technical/engineering managers:**

Q: What are the expected responsibilities within the first 3-6 months?

> Why? TODO

Q: How do you measure success of individual contributors?

> Why? TODO

Q: Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?

> Why? I don't like putting people on the spot. That said, this is one of my favourite questions to ask.
> It's reassuring to hear passionate answers about future goals from managers you'd be working for if you're expecting a
> certain level of support for your own goals from them.

Q: What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you in the coming months?

> Why? TODO
